## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [Earnings-Based Stock Reaction Modeling System](https://github.com/Savin97/public-risk-engine.git)

Python • Data Engineering • ML • Financial Data

Public/open-core version of a proprietary analytics engine I built to analyze how stocks behave around earnings.
It ingests historical earnings + price data, engineers risk & behavior features, and identifies patterns in post-earnings reactions.

I structured it like a production system — modular pipeline, config-driven processing, reproducible outputs, and a Streamlit dashboard UI.

Tech: Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, APIs, Streamlit, Tableau

Highlights

- Multi-window return & volatility metrics

- Drift, momentum & statistical earnings-behavior features

- Surprise bucketing & direction classification

- Rolling frequency & stability analysis

- Clean modular architecture (ingestion → features → scoring → output)


🔐 Proprietary feature engineering & scoring logic is intentionally omitted in the public version.
