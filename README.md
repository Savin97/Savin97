## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [Earnings-Based Stock Reaction Modeling System](https://github.com/Savin97/public-risk-engine.git)
(Python / ML / Financial Data)
Stocks react unpredictably to earnings announcements. The goal of this project is to analyze historical earnings data, compute engineered signals, and identify statistical patterns in post-earnings price behavior.
The purpose was to understand behavioral patterns around earnings announcements.
I structured the code as a production-style package with separate modules for ingestion, feature engineering, merging, configuration, and output.
It’s fully reproducible and extendable.
**Tech:** Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, APIs, NLP (spaCy/NLTK), Tableau 

- Multi-window return & volatility calculations
- Drift, momentum, and statistical feature engineering
- Surprise bucketing + direction classification
- Rolling frequency analysis
  
- Modular pipeline architecture
- Ingestion + cleaning + transformation + output
- Configurable & production-style code design
